$ git push -f origin master OR git push -u origin master

# see what your repo is linked to
$ git remote -v

$ git reset --soft HEAD~1
# and commit and add the file again.

======================= pull ===================

# How to delete remote repository on github?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23914342/how-to-delete-remote-repository-on-github

Go to the settings page of your repo and the bottom you can find the "Delete this repository" button under the Danger Zone area. 
Enter your repository name to confirm the deletion and click "I understand the consequences, delete this repository" to confirm the operation. 
The url will endup like below if you visit the settings page of you repository,

https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME/settings
For example, if your name is john and have a repository named "sample_john" the url would look like this,

https://github.com/john/sample_john/settings
Warning: Doing the above operation will permanently delete your repository, wiki, issues, and comments, and remove all collaborator associations.


========================
# to create a new local branch, do:
$ git branch <branch-name> OR git checkout -b <branch-name>
# both create a branch but checkout switch to the new branch

# You can set this up by default by doing:
$ git branch -u github/master master
# which will allow you to do a git push from master without specifying the remote or branch.

# To push it to the remote repository, do:
$ git push -u origin <branch-name>

$ git push -u origin HEAD
# Using HEAD is a "handy way to push the current branch to the same name on the remote". 
# HEAD (in uppercase) is a reference to the top of the current branch (tree).

# you can even short the push command by inserting this command line one time only:
git config --global push.default simple
# So next time instead of using git push origin master you just need:
git push

=============================================
change the directory to c drive by typing 
$ cd ~
